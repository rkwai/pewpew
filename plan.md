- Create visual indicators for active power-ups
- Add transition effects between weapon types
- Implement power-up stacking logic

## Milestone 5: Enemy Variety (Week 6)

### Basic Enemy Types
- Design and implement different enemy ships:
  - Kamikaze enemies (charge at player)
  - Turret enemies (stationary, shoot at player)
  - Formation flyers (move in patterns)

### Enemy Behavior
- Implement AI for different enemy types
- Create enemy spawning patterns and waves
- Add enemy shooting mechanics
- Implement enemy health systems

### Visual Variety
- Import and configure multiple enemy .glb models
- Add unique effects for each enemy type
- Implement death animations for each enemy type
- Create enemy-specific weapon effects

## Milestone 6: Boss Battles (Week 7-8)

### Boss Design
- Design multi-phase boss encounters
- Import and configure boss .glb models
- Implement boss health system with multiple health bars
- Create distinctive visual effects for bosses

### Boss Mechanics
- Implement unique attack patterns for each boss

- Add weak points that need to be targeted
- Implement phase transition animations

### Boss Battle Integration
- Create boss introduction sequences
- Add music and sound effect changes for boss battles
- Implement boss-specific arenas/backgrounds
- Create victory conditions and rewards

## Polishing Phase (Week 9)

### Performance Optimization
- Optimize rendering for better performance
- Implement object pooling for bullets and particles
- Add level-of-detail adjustments based on distance
- Optimize collision detection

### Audio Implementation
- Add background music for different levels
- Implement sound effects for all game actions
- Add audio mixing and volume controls
- Create adaptive music system based on gameplay intensity

### Visual Polish
- Add screen-space effects (bloom, chromatic aberration)
- Implement camera effects (shake, zoom)
- Add particle systems for enhanced visual appeal
- Polish all animations and transitions

### Final Testing & Deployment
- Perform cross-browser testing
- Fix any remaining bugs
- Optimize for different devices and screen sizes
- Create final build and deployment

## Post-Launch Plans (Ongoing)

### Additional Content
- Design and implement new levels
- Add more enemy types and bosses
- Create new power-ups and weapons
- Implement player ship variants

### Community Features
- Add leaderboards
- Implement achievement system
- Create level editor (optional)
- Add social sharing features

## Notes for Implementation

- For each milestone, the provided .glb models will be integrated
- Each milestone should build upon the previous, maintaining code quality and performance
- Regular testing should be performed throughout development
- Consider implementing a debug mode for easier testing and balancing
