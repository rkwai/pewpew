3D Models Directory
===================

This directory is where you should place your .glb model files for the game.

Required Models:
---------------
1. spaceship.glb - The player's spaceship model
2. asteroid.glb - The asteroid model

The game will use placeholder models if these files are not found, but for the best experience, 
please add your own models with these exact filenames.

Where to Find Models:
-------------------
You can create your own models using Blender or other 3D modeling software, or download free
models from sites such as:
- Sketchfab (https://sketchfab.com/feed)
- Poly Pizza (https://poly.pizza/)
- TurboSquid (https://www.turbosquid.com/Search/3D-Models/free)

Make sure to respect licensing terms when using models from these sites.
